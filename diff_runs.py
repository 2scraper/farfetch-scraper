diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku` —
the identifier the README already tells people to diff on for price
monitoring and assortment tracking, but that nothing in this repo actually
computed.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old girls_clothing.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new girls_clothing.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one of the four scraper engines, kept
under a dated filename, diffed against the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url "$URL" --out "girls_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "girls_$(ls -t girls_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "girls_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Three buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added     — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed   — sku present in --old, absent from --new (delisted, or just off
              this particular page/category run)
  changed   — sku present in both, with a different price, original_price,
              discount_pct, currency or in_stock

A product this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.
